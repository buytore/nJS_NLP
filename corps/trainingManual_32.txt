Training Manual:
A training manual is a book or booklet of instructions, designed to improve the quality of a performed task. Training manuals are widely used, including in business and the military.

A training manual may be particularly useful as:

an introduction to subject matter prior to training
an outline to be followed during training
a reference to subject matter after training
a general reference document
