Project Coordination:
Project coordination generally refers to planning and managing multiple tasks simultaneously. Coordination is essential for a business that deals with two or more related projects. Projects vary based on business objectives but may include launching a new product or expanding services into new areas. 
A project coordinator often holds different roles and responsibilities, depending on the industry, business size, and project goal. For example, corporations might designate separate project coordinators to handle domestic and international affairs; whereas, small businesses might weave basic project coordination duties into a management role.
