Evaluation Plan:
An evaluation plan is a roadmap that identifies the goals and ways in which you'll collect and analyze data. This includes which information you'll collect, along with how, where and when you'll collect it. It identifies your research methods, those responsible for carrying out the plan, timelines and budget.
