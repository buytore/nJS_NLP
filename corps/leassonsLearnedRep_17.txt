Lessons Learned Repository:
The purpose of lessons learned is to bring together any insights gained during a project that can be usefully applied on future projects. Everything learned from previous projects, whether they were successes or failures can teach a project manager important lessons. And individual project managers usually do learn from their own previous experiences, but are these "lessons learned" shared with others within the project team or within the same organization? If they are shared, do other project managers apply the lessons to their own projects? A main focus of the PMO is to capture lessons learned, share them across our organization, and play a part in helping project managers apply these lessons to their own projects.
