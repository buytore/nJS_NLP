Ideation:
Ideation is the creative process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an idea is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.[1] Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from innovation, to development, to actualization.[2] As such, it is an essential part of the design process, both in education and practice.[3] The word "ideation" has come under criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,[4] as well as being inappropriately similar to the term for suicidal ideation.[5]
It can help with gathering ideas and creating new ideas.
